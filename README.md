# Microservices in express-js 

This is one package that allows to easily deploy one API based on microservices. Born after i mane one API and allows the DEV to easily skip boilerplate code and quickly deploy one API

## NOTE

This package us still under massive development. **If you think you should, please, open one issue**

### To install
npm i easy-microservices-app


### Settings.json

This file will tell package where to get what he needs. The following table explains the entries on the example settings.json file

| entry | meaning  |
|--|--|
| microservices | contains two key-value pairs saying where will all the microservices be located and what is the main file that loads the service after found |
| middlewares | The package wants middlewares to process values like output errors. Here, you have to put where is the middleware and say if is one response middleware or request. You have to specify what is the parser function name for the middleware. The app will looke there  |
| models | It is a work in progress but for now but the goal is to be able to inject models. in the example, i am injecting onde model for error response and sucess respose. You can say what is the method that parses responses but is not implemented. In fact, this hole thing is king of green. Too much |
| postgresql | The Db connection. For now i **only support postgresql**|

### To use
ItÂ´s simple enough to use. You have to create your service starting with one file named "Router.js" inside of the service folder. You have to put all the services inside the same folder.

- You have it out of the box, but if you want. Create one settings json file with postgres db credentials and then use its path to start the app.

>     {
			>     "postgresql": {
			>     "user": "MY USER",
			>     "password": "PASSWORD",
			>     "database": "DB NAME",
			>     "host": "HOST",
			>     "port": 5432,
			>     "max": 20,
			>     "idleTimeoutMillis": 30000,
			>     "connectionTimeoutMillis": 20000
			>     }    
>     }

- Call start with the port and settings file location Eg : startApp(3333, './config/settings.json');

- Create one resources folder on project root

- Create the microservice folder on resources folder just created

- Microservice should have has the entry point the Router.js file. You can and should use the structure of the example file. That file has to extend from the npm RouterWorkerClass

- The file that you will use to query Db, should extend DbWOrker class of the npm if you want out of the box queries and transactions

You have one example folder named **usage_example** with one service inside **folder routers**.
